## 👋 About

Hi! I'm Juan Naputi.

I started **Project Anzu** as a personal effort to build meaningful, open-source tools that help the underserved gain visibility, agency, and support — especially in places where infrastructure fails or access is denied.

## 🧭 Motivations

This project was born out of a few persistent truths:

- Individuals, communities, organizations, and governments are often overwhelmed — with too little support and too many expectations.
- The modern tech economy prioritizes profit over impact.
- Most technology serves the connected, not the forgotten.

I believe in:

- 🧭 **Offline-first tools**, where internet is an enhancement—not a requirement  
- 🔦 **Visibility for the invisible**, especially those silenced by circumstance  
- 📦 **Modularity, transparency, and dignity-first design**  
- 🔓 **Radical openness** — everything I build is free to use, adapt, and extend

## 🧠 Philosophy

These tools are designed for offline-first environments, where **modern conveniences like cloud infrastructure may be unavailable**.

Until every individual on earth has access to reliable connectivity, **we must build tools that emit signal when infrastructure allows**—rather than depending on infrastructure to always be there.

This isn’t just a technical constraint. It’s a **philosophical position**:
> *Build for the world as it is, not just as it might be.*

## 🕯️ Personal Note

Because of my work and life commitments, I can’t always contribute every day or even every week. But this endeavor means a great deal to me.

I had the honor of knowing people who:

- Lived in difficult, unjust conditions—because they had no choice but to send money back to those they loved  
- Cried when I spoke to them, simply because someone cared to ask  
- Made me feel at home—not through perfection, but through shared humanity

It’s been two years since I returned home.  
The weight of it never left.  
And I can never unsee what I’ve seen.

## 🤝 An Invitation

This is a solo project for now, but it’s not meant to stay that way.

If you're a developer, researcher, field worker, translator, or just someone who believes in the mission — I welcome you to contribute, fork, translate, and help guide Project Anzu into whatever it needs to become.

> You don’t need to be perfect to contribute. You just need to care.
